            <h2>Description</h2>
              <p>This is a Hernandez family classic. While I wish I could take credit for this masterpiece, it's a Pioneer Woman Recipe</p>
              <p>Whether a morning treat, a celebration meal, or a comfort food, it's the perfect treat for any occasion.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients </h3>
              <ul>
                <li>2 c. All-Purpose Flour</li>
                <li>3 tsp. Baking Powder</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp. Salt</li>
                <li>1/4 c. Sugar</li>
                <li>1 1/2 c. Milk</li>
                <li>2 Whole Egg Yolks</li>
                <li>1 tbsp. Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>1 tsp. (additional) Vanilla Extract</li>
                <li>1 stick Unsalted Butter, Melted</li>
                <li>4 Whole Egg Whites</li>
              </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
              <ol>
                <li>Preheat the waffle iron to 3.5</li>
                <li>Sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together milk, 2 egg yolks, and vanilla. Pour over the dry ingredients and very gently stir until halfway combined. Pour in the melted butter and continue mixing very gently until combined.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl (or using a mixer), beat the egg whites with a whisk until stiff. Slowly fold them into the batter, stopping short of mixing them all the way through.</li>
                <li>Scoop the batter into your waffle iron in batches and cook according to its directions (lean toward being a little deep golden and crisp!) Remove and serve immediately with softened butter and warm syrup.</li>

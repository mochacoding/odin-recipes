        <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>The last in this classic series. A perfect blend of comfort and class - the crepe.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>3 tbsp. Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>1 c. All Purpose Flour</li>
            <li>1 tbsp. Granulated Sugar</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp. Salt</li>
            <li>3/4 c. Whole Milk</li>
            <li>1/2 c. Room Temperature Water</li>
            <li>2 Large Eggs. Room Temperature</li>
            <li>1 and 1/2 tsp. Pure Vanilla Extract</li>
          </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in microwave. Set aside. This should be first that it has a few minutes to cool while you prepare the other ingredients.</li>
            <li>Combine the cooled melted butter, flour, sugar, salt, milk, water, eggs, and vanilla in a blender or large food processor. The mixture will be sikly smooth and the consistency of cream. Cover the blender tightly or pour into a medium bowl, cover tightly, and chill in the refrigerator for 30-60 minutes and up to 1 day.</li>
            <li>Cook the crepes! You can butter the pan first, but if your nonstick pan is good, you really don't have to. They look tastier with the butter, but also uses quite a bit of butter by the end.</li>
            <li>Fill the crepes. We like cool whip and ovaltine (chocolate cool whip, anyone?) or nutella.</li>
          </ol>
